This is a repository for following the Udemy course on NodeJs / React Authentication: https://www.udemy.com/course/react-node-authentication .
I am not the author of said course, I just decided to make my version of the project code available.
- The dependencies are up-to-date as of March 2024, you may need to update them if you find this later.
- Run `npm i` to install all dependencies before running `npm start` for the first time.
- Run `mailhog` to run the local instance of mailhog.
